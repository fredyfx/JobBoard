# JobBoard
Write Python Scripts to create a Job Board web app and api with ASP.NET MVC Core.

## Some highlights from my contributions include:
1. [Writing Python web crawlers, scrapers, and JSON parsers.](Python Scripts/web_crawler.py)
2. [Writing a controller to display content as pure JSON.](JobBoard/Controllers/JsonJobContentController.cs)
3. [Writing a seed data model to initialize database.](JobBoard/Models/SeedDataModel/SeedData.cs)
